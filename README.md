# Customer Churn Prediction using ANNs



Customer churn prediction is a common problem in the telecommunications, e-commerce, and subscription-based industries. It involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service in the near future. To address this challenge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be utilized as a powerful machine learning technique for predicting customer churn.

This repository provides an implementation of a customer churn prediction model using ANNs. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at a high risk of churning, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain those customers.
