# Customer Churn Prediction using ANNs


Customer churn prediction is a common problem in the telecommunications, e-commerce, and subscription-based industries. It involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service in the near future. To address this challenge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be utilized as a powerful machine learning technique for predicting customer churn.

This repository provides an implementation of a customer churn prediction model using ANNs. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at a high risk of churning, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is linked: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and  movies.
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
